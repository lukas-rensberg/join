        <p>We are pleased that you are interested in our webpage. The protection of your Personal Data is particularly
            important to our management. As a rule, you can use our websites without disclosing any Personal Data to us.
            However, if you wish to use more specific services via our websites, including our other websites,
            applications and social media pages, we may have to process your Personal Data. If we wish to process data
            about you, and we cannot rely on any other legal basis, we will always ask you for your Consent first (e.g.,
            via a cookie banner).</p>
        <p>We always comply with applicable data protection laws when handling your Personal Data (such as name,
            address, email or telephone number). With this Privacy Policy, we inform you about which data we process.
            This Privacy Policy also explains to you what rights you have as a Data Subject.</p>
        <p>We have taken various technical and organizational measures to protect your data on our websites in the best
            possible way. Nevertheless, there are always risks on the internet and complete protection is not possible.
            For this reason, you can also transmit your Personal Data to us by other means, for example by telephone, if
            you prefer.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is not only intended to fulfill the obligations under GDPR and to comply with the law of
            the Member States of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). This Privacy Policy is
            also intended to comply with legislation such as UK data protection laws (UK-GDPR), Swiss Federal Data
            Protection Act and Swiss Data Protection Ordinance (DSG, DSV), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA),
            China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA), Tennessee

            Consumer Privacy Bill (House Bill 4696) and other global data protection regulations and shall be
            interpreted accordingly. The following Privacy Policy shall be interpreted for each country, state or
            federal state in such a way that the terms and legal bases used correspond to the terms and legal bases used
            in the respective state or federal state.</p>
        <p>For reasons of better readability, the simultaneous use of the language forms male, female, diverse and other
            gender identities (m/f/d/other) is avoided on our websites, in publications, in communication and in our
            Privacy Policy. All formulations used apply equally to all genders.</p>
        <h2><strong>1. Definitions</strong></h2>
        <p>In our Privacy Policy, we use special terms from various data protection laws. We want our statement to be
            easy to understand and therefore explain these terms in advance.</p>
        <p>The following definitions shall be interpreted or expanded, as appropriate, based on the case law of the
            General Court of the European Union (EGC), the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the Swiss Federal Supreme
            Court (SFSC), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (UKSC) or on national data protection laws or national
            case law of a state or federal state, including but not limited to California, including case law, also
            under common law, if this is necessary for the application of the law in individual cases.</p>
        <p>We use the following terms, among others, in this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <p>a) Personal Data</p>
        <p>Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable
            natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
            identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
            factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of
            that natural person, or who must be regarded as such under national data protection legislation or national
            jurisdiction of a state or federal state, including under common law.</p>
        <p>b) Data Subject</p>
        <p>Data Subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose Personal Data is processed by the
            Controller, a Processor, an international organization or another data recipient, and persons who must be
            regarded as such under national data protection laws or national jurisdiction of a state or federal state,
            including case law, also under common law.</p>
        <p>c) Processing</p>
        <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal
            Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
            adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
            otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
        <p>d) Restriction of Processing</p>
        <p>Restriction of Processing is the marking of stored Personal Data with the aim of limiting their Processing in
            the future.</p>
        <p>e) Profiling</p>
        <p>Profiling is any form of automated Processing of Personal Data consisting of the use of Personal Data to
            evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
            concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
            interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
        <p>f) Pseudonymization</p>
        <p>Pseudonymization is the Processing of Personal Data in such a manner that the Personal Data can no longer be
            attributed to a specific Data Subject without the use of additional information, provided that such
            additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure
            that the Personal Data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
        <p>g) Controller</p>
        <p>The Controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
            with others, determines the purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data. Where the purposes and
            means of such Processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the Controller or the specific
            criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
        <p>h) Processor</p>
        <p>A Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal
            Data on behalf of the Controller.</p>
        <p>i) Recipient</p>
        <p>A Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the Personal
            Data are disclosed, whether a Third Party or not. However, public authorities which may receive Personal
            Data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be
            regarded as recipients.</p>
        <p>j) Third Party</p>
        <p>A Third Party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the Data Subject,
            Controller, Processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the Controller or Processor, are
            authorised to process Personal Data.</p>
        <p>k) Consent</p>
        <p>Consent is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the Data Subject’s wishes by
            which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the Processing of
            Personal Data relating to him or her.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>2. Name and address of the Controller</strong></h2>
        <p>The Controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation, other data protection laws

        <h2><strong>3. Collection of general data and information</strong></h2>
        <p>Our websites collect a range of general data and information each time the websites are accessed by a Data
            Subject or an automated system. This general data and information are stored in the log files of the
            respective server. Among other things, the (1) browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system
            used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our websites
            (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites which are accessed via an accessing system on our websites, (5)
            the date and time of access to the website, (6) an internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the internet
            service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information used for security
            purposes in the event of attacks on our information technology systems can be recorded.</p>
        <p>When using this general data and information, we generally do not draw any conclusions about the Data
            Subject. Rather, this information is required to (1) correctly deliver the content of our websites, (2)
            optimize the content of our websites and the advertising for them, (3) ensure the long-term functionality of
            our information technology systems and the technology of our websites and (4) provide law enforcement
            authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in the event of a cyber-attack. This
            anonymously collected data and information is therefore evaluated by us both statistically and with the aim
            of increasing data protection and data security in our organisation to ultimately ensure an optimal level of
            protection for the Personal Data processed by us. The data of the server log files are stored separately
            from all Personal Data provided by a Data Subject.</p>
        <p>The purpose of processing is to avert danger and ensure IT security, as well as the aforementioned purposes.
            The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is the protection of our information
            technology systems. The log files are deleted after the stated purposes have been achieved.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>4. Contact possibility via the website and other data transfers and your Consent</strong></h2>
        <p>Our website contains information that enables quick electronic contact with our organisation as well as
            direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (email
            address) and possibly a telephone number. If a Data Subject contacts us by email, via a contact form, via an
            input form or in any other way, the Personal Data transmitted by the Data Subject will be stored
            automatically. This Personal Data transmitted to us on a voluntary basis by a Data Subject is processed for
            the purposes of usage or contacting the Data Subject.</p>
        <p>We obtain your Consent for the transmission, storage and Processing of your contact data and inquiries and
            for contacting you in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Art. 49 (1) (1) (a) GDPR as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>By transmitting your Personal Data, you voluntarily consent to the Processing of the Personal Data
            you have entered or transmitted for the purposes of processing the inquiry and contacting you. By
            transmitting your data to us, you also voluntarily give your explicit Consent in accordance with Art. 49 (1)
            (1) (a) GDPR to data transfers to third countries to and by the companies named in this Privacy Policy and
            for the purposes stated, in particular for such transfers to third countries for which there is or is not an
            adequacy decision by the EU/EEA and to companies or other bodies that are not subject to an existing
            adequacy decision on the basis of self-certification or other accession criteria and in which or for which
            there are significant risks and no suitable guarantees for the protection of your Personal Data (e.g., due
            to Section 702 FISA, Executive Order EO12333 and the CloudAct in the USA). When you gave your voluntary and
            explicit Consent, you were aware that there may not be an adequate level of data protection in third
            countries and that your data subject rights may not be enforceable. You can withdraw your Consent under data
            protection law at any time with effect for the future. The withdrawal of Consent does not affect the
            lawfulness of Processing based on Consent before its withdrawal. With a single action (entry and
            transmission), you give several Consents. These are Consents under EU/EEA data protection law as well as
            those under the CCPA/CPRA, ePrivacy and telemedia law, and other international legislation, which are
            required, among other things, as a legal basis for any planned further Processing of your Personal Data.
            With your action, you also confirm that you have read and taken note of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>5. Routine deletion and restriction of Personal Data</strong></h2>
        <p>We process and store Personal Data for the period required to achieve the purpose of processing or if this
            has been provided for by the European legislator or another legislator in laws or regulations to which we
            are subject, or if a legal basis for the Processing exists.</p>
        <p>If the purpose of processing no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator
            or another competent legislator expires, or if the legal basis for the Processing no longer applies, the
            Personal Data will be routinely restricted or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>6. Rights of the Data Subject according to GDPR</strong></h2>
        <p>a) Right to confirmation</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to obtain from the Controller confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data
            concerning him or her is being processed.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>b) Right to information</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to obtain from the Controller free information about the Personal Data stored
            about him/her and a copy of this data at any time. Furthermore, the European legislator has granted the Data
            Subject access to the following information:</p>
        <p>• the purposes of processing,</p>
        <p>• the categories of Personal Data that are processed,</p>
        <p>• the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data have been or will be disclosed, in
            particular recipients in third countries or international organizations,</p>
        <p>• where possible, the envisaged period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or, if not possible, the
            criteria used to determine that period,</p>
        <p>• the existence of the right to request from the Controller rectification or erasure of Personal Data or
            Restriction of Processing of Personal Data concerning the Data Subject or to object to such Processing,</p>
        <p>• the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority,</p>
        <p>• if the Personal Data is not collected from the Data Subject: All available information about the origin of
            the data,</p>
        <p>• the existence of automated decision-making, including Profiling, referred to in Art. 22 (1) and (4) GDPR
            and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance
            and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for the Data Subject.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Data Subject has a right to information as to whether Personal Data has been transferred to
            a third country or to an international organization. If this is the case, the Data Subject also has the
            right to obtain information about the appropriate safeguards in connection with the transfer.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>c) Right to rectification</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to demand the immediate correction of incorrect Personal Data concerning
            them. Furthermore, the Data Subject has the right to request the completion of incomplete Personal Data,
            including by means of a supplementary declaration, taking into account the purposes of the Processing.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>d) Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right, to obtain from the Controller the erasure of Personal Data concerning him or
            her without undue delay, and the Controller shall have the obligation to erase Personal Data without undue
            delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the Processing is not necessary:</p>
        <p>• Personal Data was collected or otherwise processed for purposes for which it is no longer necessary.</p>
        <p>• The Data Subject withdraws Consent on which the Processing is based according to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, or
            Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the Processing.</p>
        <p>• The Data Subject objects to the Processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and there are no overriding
            legitimate grounds for the Processing, or the Data Subject objects to the Processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2)
            GDPR.</p>
        <p>• Personal Data was processed unlawfully.</p>
        <p>• The deletion of Personal Data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the
            Member States to which the Controller is subject.</p>
        <p>• The Personal Data was collected in relation to information society services offered in accordance with Art.
            8 (1) GDPR.</p>
        <p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a Data Subject wishes to request the erasure of Personal
            Data stored by us, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>If we have made the Personal Data public and if our organisation is obliged to delete the Personal Data in
            accordance with Art. 17 (1) GDPR, we shall take appropriate measures, including technical measures, taking
            into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform other data Controllers who
            process the published Personal Data that the Data Subject has requested the deletion of all links to this
            Personal Data or of copies or replications of this Personal Data from these other data Controllers, insofar
            as the Processing is not necessary.</p>
        <p>e) Right to Restriction of Processing</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to obtain from the Controller Restriction of Processing where one of the
            following applies:</p>
        <p>• The accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by the Data Subject, for a period enabling the Controller to
            verify the accuracy of the Personal Data.</p>
        <p>• The Processing is unlawful, and the Data Subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Data and requests the
            restriction of their use instead.</p>
        <p>• The Controller no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of the Processing, but they are required
            by the Data Subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
        <p>• The Data Subject has objected to Processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR pending the verification whether
            the legitimate grounds of the Controller override those of the Data Subject.</p>
        <p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a Data Subject wishes to request the restriction of the
            Processing of Personal Data stored by us, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>f) Right to data portability</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to receive the Personal Data concerning him or her, which he or she has
            provided to a Controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she also has the
            right to transmit those data to another Controller without hindrance from the Controller to which the
            Personal Data have been provided, where Processing is based on Consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or
            Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR and the Processing is carried out by
            automated means, unless the Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in exercising their right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 (1) GDPR, the Data Subject has
            the right to have the Personal Data transmitted directly from one Controller to another, where technically
            feasible and provided that this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>g) Right to object</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any
            time, to Processing of Personal Data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article
            6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to Profiling based on these provisions.</p>
        <p>In the event of an objection, we will no longer process the Personal Data unless we can demonstrate
            compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the
            Data Subject or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
        <p>If we process Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, the Data Subject shall have the right to object at
            any time to Processing of Personal Data concerning him or her for such marketing. This also applies to
            Profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. If the Data Subject objects to us to the
            Processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the Personal Data for these
            purposes.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Data Subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to
            object to Processing of Personal Data concerning him or her by us for scientific or historical research
            purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the Processing is
            necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time. The Data Subject is
            also free, in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive
            2002/58/EC, to exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>
        <p>h) Automated decisions in individual cases including Profiling</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated Processing,
            including Profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects
            him or her, provided that the decision (1) is not necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract
            between the Data Subject and the Controller, or (2) is authorized by Union or Member State law to which the
            Controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject's rights and
            freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is based on the Data Subject's explicit Consent.</p>
        <p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the Data
            Subject and a data Controller, or (2) it is based on the Data Subject's explicit Consent, we shall implement
            suitable measures to safeguard the Data Subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the
            right to obtain human intervention on the part of the Controller, to express his or her point of view and
            contest the decision.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>i) Right to withdraw Consent under data protection law</p>
        <p>Each Data Subject has the right to withdraw Consent to the Processing of Personal Data at any time.</p>
        <p>If a Data Subject wishes to exercise this right, he or she may contact us at any time.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>7. General purpose of Processing, categories of processed data and categories of recipients</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>The general purpose of processing Personal Data is the handling of all activities relating to the Controller,
            customers, interested parties, business partners or other contractual or pre-contractual relationships
            between the aforementioned groups (in the broadest sense) or legal obligations of the Controller. This
            general purpose applies if no more specific purposes for specific Processing are specified.</p>
        <p>The categories of Personal Data that we process are customer data, prospective customer data, employee data
            (including applicant data) and supplier data. The categories of recipients of Personal Data are public
            bodies, external bodies, internal processing, intragroup processing and other bodies.</p>
        <p>A list of our Processors and data recipients in third countries and, if applicable, international
            organizations is either published on our website or can be requested from us free of charge.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>8. Legal basis for the Processing</strong></h2>
        <p>Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for Processing operations for which we obtain Consent for a
            specific Processing purpose. If the Processing of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which the Data Subject is party, as is the case, for example, when Processing operations are
            necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service or consideration, Processing is based on
            Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. The same applies to such Processing operations that are necessary to carry out
            pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If we are
            subject to a legal obligation which requires the Processing of Personal Data, such as for the fulfillment of
            tax obligations, Processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR.</p>
        <p>In rare cases, it may be necessary to process Personal Data to protect the vital interests of the Data
            Subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our
            organisation and their name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed
            on to a doctor, hospital or other Third Party. The Processing would then be based on Art. 6 (1) (d)
            GDPR.</p>
        <p>If the Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
            exercise of official authority vested in the Controller, the legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (e) GDPR.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Processing operations could be based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. This legal basis is used for
            Processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if Processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our organisation or by a Third Party,
            except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data
            Subject which require protection of Personal Data. We are permitted to carry out such Processing operations
            in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it
            took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed, for example, if the Data Subject is a customer of
            the Controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>9. Legitimate interests in Processing pursued by the Controller or a Third Party and direct
            marketing</strong></h2>
        <p>If the Processing of Personal Data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR and no more specific legitimate interests
            are stated, our legitimate interest is the performance of our business activities for the benefit of the
            well-being of our staff and our shareholders.</p>
        <p>We may send you direct advertising about our own goods or services that are similar to the goods or services
            you have requested, commissioned or purchased. You may object to direct advertising at any time (e.g. by
            email). You will not incur any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. The
            Processing of Personal Data for direct marketing purposes is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate
            interest is direct marketing.</p>
        <p>Our messages and newsletters may also constitute direct marketing communications within the meaning of
            Article 13(2) of EU Directive 2002/58 (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) and the national
            law resulting from the Directive, provided that we have obtained your electronic and other contact
            information in connection with the sale of a service or product, which includes the creation of a free user
            account that allows you, among other things, to access free content on our websites and publications
            (newsletters, etc.), provided that we advertise similar products or services through direct marketing, so
            that direct marketing is also permissible without consent (see ECJ, judgment of November 13, 2025, Case C
            654/23). In such cases, you can refuse the use of your contact information at any time free of charge.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>10. Duration for which the Personal Data is stored</strong></h2>
        <p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of Personal Data is the respective statutory retention period.
            If there is no statutory retention period, the criterion is the contractual or internal retention period.
            After this period has expired, the corresponding data is routinely deleted if it is no longer required to
            fulfill or initiate a contract. This applies in particular to all Processing operations for which no more
            specific criteria have been defined.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>11. Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of Personal Data; necessity for the conclusion
            of the contract; obligation of the Data Subject to provide the Personal Data; possible consequences of
            non-provision</strong></h2>
        <p>We would like to inform you that the provision of Personal Data is partly required by law (e.g., tax
            regulations) or may also result from contractual obligations (e.g., information on the contractual partner).
            Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded for a Data Subject to provide us with Personal
            Data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, Data Subjects are obliged to provide us with
            Personal Data if our organisation concludes a contract with them. Failure to provide Personal Data would
            mean that the contract with the Data Subject could not be concluded. The Data Subject must contact us before
            providing Personal Data. We will inform the Data Subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of
            the Personal Data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether
            there is an obligation to provide the Personal Data and what the consequences would be if the Personal Data
            were not provided.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>12. Existence of automated decision-making</strong></h2>
        <p>As a responsible company, we do not normally use automated decision-making or Profiling. If, in exceptional
            cases, we carry out automated decision-making or Profiling, we will inform the Data Subject either
            separately or via a sub-item in our Privacy Policy (here on our website). In this case, the following
            applies:</p>
        <p>Automated decision-making, including Profiling, may take place if (1) this is necessary for the conclusion or
            performance of a contract between the Data Subject and us, or (2) this is permissible on the basis of Union
            or Member State legislation to which we are subject and this legislation contains appropriate measures to
            safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the Data Subject, or (3) this takes place with
            the explicit Consent of the Data Subject.</p>
        <p>In the cases referred to in Art. 22 (2) (a) and (c) GDPR, we shall implement suitable measures to safeguard
            the Data Subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests. In these cases, you have the right to
            obtain human intervention on the part of the Controller, to express your point of view and to contest the
            decision.</p>
        <p>Meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such Processing for the
            Data Subject will be provided in this Privacy Policy where applicable.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>13. Recipients in a third country and appropriate or adequate safeguards and how to obtain a copy of
            them or where they are available.</strong></h2>
        <p>According to Art. 46 (1) GDPR, the Controller or Processor may only transfer Personal Data to a third country
            if the Controller or Processor has provided appropriate safeguards and if enforceable rights and effective
            legal remedies are available to the Data Subjects. Appropriate safeguards can be provided by standard
            contractual clauses without the need for special approval from a supervisory authority, Art. 46 (2) (c)
            GDPR.</p>
        <p>The EU standard contractual clauses or other appropriate safeguards are agreed with all recipients from third
            countries prior to the first transfer of Personal Data, or the transfers are based on adequacy decisions.
            Consequently, it is ensured that appropriate safeguards, enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are
            guaranteed for all Processing of Personal Data. Any Data Subject can obtain a copy of the standard
            contractual clauses or adequacy decisions from us. In addition, the standard contractual clauses and
            adequacy decisions are available in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
        <p>Art. 45 (3) GDPR authorizes the European Commission to decide by means of an implementing decision that a
            non-EU country ensures an adequate level of protection. This means a level of protection for Personal Data
            that essentially corresponds to the level of protection within the EU. Adequacy decisions mean that Personal
            Data can flow from the EU (as well as from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to a third country without
            further obstacles. Similar regulations apply to the United Kingdom, Switzerland and some other
            countries.</p>
        <p>In all cases where the European Commission, or a government or competent authority of another country, has
            decided that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection and/or a valid framework exists (e.g.,
            EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
            Framework), all transfers by us to the members of such frameworks (e.g., self-certified entities) are based
            solely on the membership of that entity in the respective framework or on the respective adequacy decisions.
            If we or one of our group companies is a member of such a framework, all transfers to us or our group
            company are based exclusively on the membership of the respective company in this framework. If we or one of
            our group companies is located in a third country with an adequate level of protection, all transfers to us
            or our group company are based solely on the respective adequacy decisions.</p>
        <p>Any Data Subject can obtain a copy of the frameworks from us. In addition, the frameworks are also available
            in the Official Journal of the European Union or in the published legal materials or on the websites of data
            protection supervisory authorities or other authorities or institutions.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>14. Right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority</strong></h2>
        <p>As the Controller, we are obliged to inform the Data Subject of the existence of the right to lodge a
            complaint with a supervisory authority. The right to lodge a complaint is regulated in Art. 77 (1) GDPR.
            According to this provision, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every Data
            Subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State
            of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the Data Subject
            considers that the Processing of Personal Data relating to him or her infringes the General Data Protection
            Regulation. The right to lodge a complaint has been restricted by the EU legislator to the effect that it
            can only be exercised with a single supervisory authority (Recital 141 Sentence 1 GDPR). This provision is
            intended to avoid duplicate complaints in the same matter by the same Data Subject. If a Data Subject wishes
            to complain about us, it is therefore requested that only one supervisory authority is contacted.</p>
        <p>
        <h2><strong>15. Registration or filling in input masks on our website and your Consent</strong></h2>
        <p>You have the option of registering on our websites by providing Personal Data and/or filling out input masks.
            Which Personal Data is transmitted to us in the process is determined by the respective input mask used for
            registration or input. The Personal Data you enter will be processed exclusively for internal use by us and
            for our own purposes. However, we may pass on your Personal Data to one or more Processors, for example to
            parcel service providers, who also use your Personal Data exclusively for purposes that are attributable to
            us as the Controller. Disclosure may also take place if you have commissioned the disclosure from us. The
            legal basis is then Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.</p>
        <p>When you register or enter data on our website, the IP address assigned by your internet service provider
            (ISP), the date and time of registration or entry may also be stored. This data is stored against the
            background that this is the only way to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, to make it
            possible to investigate criminal offenses. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary for our
            security. The purpose of processing is the prevention and detection of misuse and the investigation of
            criminal offenses, as well as the aforementioned purposes. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our
            legitimate interest is in particular the protection of our information technology systems and the
            investigation of criminal offenses. This data is not disclosed to Third Parties unless there is a legal
            obligation to disclose it, or the disclosure serves the purpose of criminal prosecution.</p>
        <p>The registration, entry and transmission of your Personal Data also enables us to offer you content or
            services which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered persons or persons known
            to us. You are free to change the Personal Data provided during registration at any time or to have it
            completely deleted from our database. The purposes of processing are the receipt of data by us and the use
            of your data for further Processing, for communication with you and the illustration or implementation of
            the registration or input purposes. The legal basis is your Consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR
            and/or Art. 49 (1) (1) (a) GDPR.</p>
        <p><strong>By entering and transmitting your data, you voluntarily consent to the Processing of the Personal
            Data you have entered. By entering and transmitting your data to us, you also voluntarily give your explicit
            Consent in accordance with Art. 49 (1) (1) (a) GDPR to data transfers to third countries to and by the
            companies named in this Privacy Policy and for the purposes stated, in particular for such transfers to
            third countries for which there is or is not an adequacy decision by the EU/EEA and to companies or other
            bodies that are not subject to an existing adequacy decision on the basis of self-certification or other
            accession criteria and in which or for which there are significant risks and no suitable guarantees for the
            protection of your Personal Data (e.g., due to Section 702 FISA, Executive Order EO12333 and the CloudAct in
            the USA). When giving your voluntary and explicit Consent, you were aware that there may not be an adequate
            level of data protection in third countries and that your data subject rights may not be enforceable. You
            can withdraw your Consent under data protection law at any time with effect for the future. The withdrawal
            of Consent does not affect the lawfulness of Processing based on Consent before its withdrawal. With a
            single action (entry and transmission), you give several Consents. These are Consents under EU/EEA data
            protection law as well as those under the CCPA/CPRA, ePrivacy and telemedia law, and other international
            legislation, which are required, among other things, as a legal basis for any planned further Processing of
            your Personal Data. With your action, you also confirm that you have read and taken note of this Privacy
            Policy.</strong></p>
        <p>Upon request, we will provide any Data Subject at any time with information about which Personal Data about
            the Data Subject is stored. We will also correct or delete Personal Data at the request or notice of the
            Data Subject, provided that this does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations or other reasons
            justifying Processing. All our employees are available to you as contact persons in this context.</p>
