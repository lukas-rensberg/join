                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p><span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                    dedicated
                    students as part of their web development bootcamp at the <span>Developer Akademie</span>.
                    <br><br>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize
                    work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the
                    principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                    interface.
                    <br><br>It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is
                    not intended forextensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
                    experience, we cannot
                    guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding

                        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                        <p>When you log in to <span class="span-color">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
                            project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and
                            "Done".

                        <p>In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                            "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                            added, these contacts
                            can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                            dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another.

                            Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when
                            deleting
